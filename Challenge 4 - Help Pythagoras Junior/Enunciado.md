## **Challenge 4** - Help Pythagoras Junior

Pythagoras Junior is not a great mathematician like his great great great grandfather. When he gets a list of numbers, he finds it hard to match 3 numbers and create a triangle out of them.

You need to help Pythagoras Junior to identify which is the smallest possible triangle given a list of side lengths. We define the smallest triangle as the one with the minimum perimeter.

### Input

The first line will contain an integer **C**, the number of cases for our problem.  
Each case consists of a line starting with an integer **N**, the number of sides, followed by **N** integers, each indicating the length of a side. All the integers are separated by spaces.

### Output

For each case, a line starting with "Case #x: " followed by the perimeter of the smallest triangle or, if it's not possible to form a valid triangle, "IMPOSSIBLE". Every line is followed by a new line character.

### Examples

<table style="width:100%">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>

<pre>
Case 1:

6 13 9 1 13 17 6

</pre>

</td>

<td>

<pre>
Case 2:

7 110 40 10 1 20 60 3

</pre>

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

In Case 1, the answer is 27, as the triangle with the smallest perimeter is (13, 13, 1).  
In Case 2, the answer is IMPOSSIBLE. You cannot create a valid triangle from any three of the given numbers.  

### Limits

*   3 ≤ **N** ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
*   1 ≤ Lengths ≤ 2<sup>32</sup>

### Sample Input

<pre>
2
6 13 9 1 13 17 6
7 110 40 10 1 20 60 3
</pre>

### Sample Output

<pre>
Case #1: 27
Case #2: IMPOSSIBLE
</pre>
